# Doctor dashboard

## Purpose

Every endpoint the doctor dashboard (`/doctor-dashboard/...`, `src/app/doctor-dashboard/`, after
Arhaan's clinician prototype) calls: the doctor's day, patients and their records, call notes and
chats. Until a PROPOSED endpoint exists the screen calls it anyway, gets a 404, and shows a calm
"not available yet" line in its place. Nothing is mocked.

- Services: `doctorPortalService`, `patientRecordService`, `clinicalNoteService`, `doctorChatService`,
  plus the shared `chatService` and `videoConsultationService`.
- Types: `src/types/doctor.ts`, `patientRecord.ts`, `clinicalNote.ts`, `chat.ts`, `appointment.ts`.

Every endpoint here:

- answers `{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": ... }` (the shapes below are `data`);
- needs `Authorization: Bearer <access token>` of a user whose role is `DOCTOR`;
- only returns or changes patients the signed-in doctor treats (403 otherwise);
- uses ISO 8601 timestamps with an offset (`2026-10-28T10:30:00+05:30`) and camelCase fields;
- writes an audit entry (who, what, when) for every read of a record and every change, which
  `GET .../record` returns as `audit` (newest first).

## Requests and responses

### The patient record

#### GET `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/record` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Patient record (`/doctor-dashboard/patients/:patientId`), the Today "Next" brief, and the
flagged-symptom tick in Messages. Reading it is itself an audit entry ("Opened the record").

Field notes: `screening` is the counsellor's call before a first consultation
(`{ by, byRole, at, minutes, goal, tried, mentioned, check: string[] }`) or `null`.
`outsideMedicines: null` means "never asked", `[]` means "asked, none". `labs`, `visits` and
`prescriptions` newest first; `weights` and `hba1c` in any order. The front end derives BMI,
care week and "since the last visit" itself.

#### GET `/api/doctor/patients/snapshots` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Patients list (Programme, BMI, HbA1c columns, the Diabetes filter, search by city and
condition) and the care-week tag in Messages and Notes.

```json
[
  {
    "patientId": "42",
    "programme": "Diabetes care",
    "city": "Noida",
    "conditions": ["Type 2 diabetes"],
    "careStartedAt": "2026-07-01T10:00:00+05:30",
    "bmi": 29.4,
    "latestHba1c": { "value": 7.2, "at": "2026-09-30T09:00:00+05:30" }
  }
]
```


#### GET `/api/doctor/queue` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Today "Waiting on you", the flags in Today's day list, the Patients "Waiting on you"
filter, and the Record's "Urgent message" action. Most pressing first: severe symptoms, moderate,
mild, urgent messages, reports to review, messages for the doctor, call notes to sign, draft
prescriptions to sign; oldest first within each.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "sym_9",
    "kind": "symptom",
    "patientId": "42",
    "patientName": "Aanya Kapoor",
    "title": "Dizziness, moderate",
    "detail": "After lunch",
    "at": "2026-10-27T14:05:00+05:30",
    "severity": "Moderate",
    "urgent": false
  }
]
```

`kind` is `symptom` | `message` | `lab` | `note` | `rx`. `id` is the symptom, lab, note or
prescription id (for `message`, any stable id). `severity` only for symptoms; `urgent` only for
messages with urgent words.

#### GET `/api/doctor/work-counts` (PROPOSED)

Screen: the badges on the rail and dock (Today, Notes, Messages).

```json
{ "waitingOnYou": 4, "notesToSign": 2, "messagesForYou": 1 }
```

#### GET `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/photos` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Record "Progress photos". Answers only while the patient shares photos with this doctor
(403 otherwise). Image URLs should be short-lived signed URLs.

```json
[
  { "id": "set_1", "takenAt": "2026-08-04T08:00:00+05:30", "frontUrl": "https://...", "sideUrl": null, "weightKg": 86.2 }
]
```

`weightKg`: the weight the patient logged nearest the photos (within 3 days), or `null`.

#### POST `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/photos/viewed` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Record, when the doctor presses "Show photos". No body. Adds "Viewed the progress photos"
to the audit log.

#### POST `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/symptoms/:symptomId/acknowledgement` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Record safety strip and Trackers ("Called the patient", "Advised by message", "Booked a
visit"), and Messages (a reply can mark the flagged symptom "Advised by message").

```json
{ "outcome": "Advised by message" }
```

#### DELETE `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/symptoms/:symptomId/acknowledgement` (PROPOSED)

Screen: the toast's Undo after the above. No body.

#### POST `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/labs/:labId/review` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Record, Labs "Mark reviewed". The comment is shown to the patient with the report.

```json
{ "comment": "Your sugar is a little higher than we want. We will go through it on the call." }
```

#### POST `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/prescriptions/:prescriptionId/sign` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Record, Prescriptions "Review and sign". No body. The draft becomes the signed version;
the previous signed version becomes `SUPERSEDED`; the patient and the pharmacy see it.

#### POST `/api/doctor/patients/:patientId/private-notes` (PROPOSED)

Screen: Record, Private notes. Never shown to the patient.

```json
{ "text": "Prefers evening calls." }
```

### Call notes

The scribe drafts a note from each transcribed video consultation (transcription is a separate
consent). Nothing reaches the record or the patient's app before the doctor signs it, and medicine
changes only ever become a DRAFT prescription signed separately.

#### GET `/api/doctor/notes` (PROPOSED)

The doctor's drafts and the notes signed in the last 30 days, as `ClinicalNote[]` (the transcript
may be left empty here).

#### GET `/api/doctor/notes/:noteId` (PROPOSED)

```json
{
  "id": "note_44",
  "patientId": "42",
  "patientName": "Aanya Kapoor",
  "type": "FOLLOW_UP",
  "reason": "Monthly review",
  "callAt": "2026-10-28T10:30:00+05:30",
  "minutes": 18,
  "transcribed": true,
  "readyAt": "2026-10-28T10:50:00+05:30",
  "status": "DRAFT",
  "sections": [
    {
      "key": "summary",
      "draft": [{ "id": "note_44-summary-1", "text": "Nausea settled after week one.", "evidence": [{ "segmentId": "a3", "quote": "nausea is gone" }], "by": "scribe", "flag": null }],
      "current": [{ "id": "note_44-summary-1", "text": "Nausea settled after week one.", "evidence": [{ "segmentId": "a3", "quote": "nausea is gone" }], "by": "scribe", "flag": null }],

    { "key": "patient", "draft": [], "current": [], "checked": false }
  ],
  "medicines": [{ "id": "m1", "action": "CHANGE", "name": "Metformin", "strength": "1000 mg", "detail": "Once a day with dinner", "was": "500 mg twice a day", "evidence": [{ "segmentId": "a9", "quote": null }], "include": true }],
  "followUps": [{ "id": "f1", "text": "Send the protein guide", "owner": "Dietitian", "evidence": [], "include": true, "done": false }],
  "recordUpdates": [{ "id": "u1", "field": "allergies", "label": "Allergies", "from": "Not recorded", "to": "No known drug allergies", "include": true }],
  "checks": {},
  "transcript": [{ "id": "a3", "t": 95, "who": "patient", "text": "The nausea is gone now.", "english": null, "unsure": null, "missed": null }],
  "signed": null,
  "addenda": [],
  "history": [{ "at": "2026-10-28T10:50:00+05:30", "what": "Draft written by the scribe" }]
}
```

Field notes:

- `sections` always has the four keys in order: `summary`, `assessment`, `plan`, `patient`
  (`patient` is the summary the patient sees in their app). `draft` is the scribe's original
  (kept for "Restore"); `current` is what the doctor edits.
- A sentence's `flag` (`{ kind: "unclear" | "conflict" | "unsaid", why, options: [{ label, text }], resolved }`)
  asks the doctor to check it; an option with `text: null` removes the sentence; `resolved` holds
  the chosen option's label.
- `transcript[].t` is seconds from the start of the call; `english` renders a mostly-Hindi line;
  `unsure` is the words the transcriber was unsure of; `missed` (`{ to: "summary" | "plan", text }`)
  marks a clinical moment the draft does not use, with the sentence to add.
- `medicines[].action`: `START` | `CHANGE` | `STOP` | `CONTINUE`. `followUps[].owner`: `You` |
  `Care team` | `Dietitian`. `recordUpdates[].field`: `allergies` | `identity_verified` | `outside_medicines`.
- `checks` holds which lists the doctor ticked: `{ "medicines": true, "followUps": false, "recordUpdates": true }`.
- `signed`: `{ at, by, byQualification, prescriptionVersion, prescriptionStatus, sentToApp }` once signed.
- While `now < readyAt` the scribe is still writing; the note shows a placeholder.

#### PUT `/api/doctor/notes/:noteId` (PROPOSED)

Saves the doctor's edits to a draft. Body (`ClinicalNoteChanges`): the editable parts and one line
for the note's history. Answers with the whole updated note. On a signed note, only
`followUps[].done` may change (follow-ups ticked off after the call); anything else is 409.

```json
{
  "sections": ["...the four sections, as in GET..."],
  "medicines": ["..."],
  "followUps": ["..."],
  "recordUpdates": ["..."],
  "checks": { "medicines": true },
  "change": "Edited the Visit summary"
}
```

#### POST `/api/doctor/notes/:noteId/sign` (PROPOSED)

```json
{ "sendToApp": true }
```

Rejects (422) while a sentence has an unresolved flag, or the summary or plan is empty. On sign:
the visit (summary, assessment, plan) goes into the record's `visits` with `noteId`; included
medicine changes become a new DRAFT prescription (next version); included record updates apply;
open flagged symptoms are marked "discussed on the call"; follow-ups go to their owners; with
`sendToApp` and a non-empty `patient` section, the patient's app shows the summary and next steps
under past consultations. Answers with the signed note. A signed note is final: corrections are
addenda.

#### POST `/api/doctor/notes/:noteId/addenda` (PROPOSED)

```json
{ "text": "Patient called back: the dizziness has settled." }
```

Signed under the doctor's name with the current time. Answers with the whole updated note.

### The doctor's chats

The live chat is the existing consultation socket; the backend has no way yet for a doctor to list
their chats.

#### GET `/api/chat/doctor/sessions` (PROPOSED)

```json
[
  {
    "sessionId": 118,
    "patientId": "42",
    "patientName": "Aanya Kapoor",
    "lastMessage": { "text": "Is it fine to take it after dinner?", "fromDoctor": false, "sentAt": "2026-10-28T09:40:00+05:30", "hasFile": false },
    "waitingSince": "2026-10-28T09:40:00+05:30",
    "urgent": false,
    "unread": true
  }
]
```

`waitingSince`: the first patient message since the doctor last replied or set the chat aside
(`null` when nothing waits). `urgent`: a waiting message contains urgent words (the same rule the
patient app uses). `unread`: a message arrived after the doctor last opened the chat.

#### POST `/api/chat/sessions/:sessionId/read` (PROPOSED)

The doctor opened the chat; clears `unread`. No body.

#### POST `/api/chat/sessions/:sessionId/no-reply-needed` (PROPOSED)

"No reply needed": clears `waitingSince` without a reply. No body.

#### DELETE `/api/chat/sessions/:sessionId/no-reply-needed` (PROPOSED)

Undo of the above (from the toast). No body.

## Notes

- Wishes on existing endpoints (no frontend change needed once added):
  - `GET /api/doctor/me`: add `qualification` ("MBBS, MD (Medicine)") for the signature line on
    signed notes; the dashboard uses `specialization` until then.
  - `GET /api/appointments/doctor`: add `visitType` (`FIRST_CONSULTATION` | `FOLLOW_UP`) to tell
    first consultations from follow-ups in the day list.
- The snapshot fields could instead be added to `GET /api/doctor/patients`; `doctorPortalService`
  would then map them.
