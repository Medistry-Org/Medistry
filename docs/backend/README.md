# Backend endpoints the app needs

## Purpose

The one index of what the frontend calls. The app calls existing endpoints as they are today. Where
a screen needs something the backend does not have yet, the app calls the **PROPOSED** path in these
docs and shows "not available yet" on 404. Nothing is mocked. The same word, PROPOSED, marks these
endpoints in every doc and at the top of every `src/services/*Service.ts` file.

Every doc has the same layout: **Purpose** (screens, service, types), **Endpoints** (method, path,
status, service function, screen), **Requests and responses** (examples), **Notes**.

| Doc | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [patient-dashboard.md](patient-dashboard.md) | Home, Profile, Resources, Plans: profile, weight tracker, eligibility, subscriptions; designs not built yet |
| [consultations-and-care.md](consultations-and-care.md) | Booking a time, rescheduling, care team, prescription and deliveries, chat, video room |
| [onboarding.md](onboarding.md) | The eight questions, resume, consents, the blood test step and care packages |
| [reports.md](reports.md) | Lab report upload and list |
| [lab-tests-redcliffe.md](lab-tests-redcliffe.md) | Home blood tests: each route mapped to the Redcliffe client, the slot hold, webhooks, env vars |
| [payments-razorpay.md](payments-razorpay.md) | Razorpay orders, signature verification, fulfilment (plan, lab booking, consultation fee), webhooks |
| [doctor-dashboard.md](doctor-dashboard.md) | The doctor's day, patient record, call notes, doctor chat list |

## Conventions the app expects

- JSON envelope `{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": ... }`; `success: false` with a
  readable `message` on failure (the app shows it as is).
- `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>` from `/api/auth/verify-otp`; the JWT carries `role`
  (`PATIENT` or `DOCTOR`) and the user id.
- 404 means "endpoint not built". For a missing record (no such booking, plan or slot), answer 400,
  409 or 422 with a message instead, so the screen shows the real reason.
- Secrets (Redcliffe key, Razorpay secret) live only on the backend.
- Patients never choose a doctor; `GET /api/doctors` is not called by the app.

## Live backend check (28 Oct 2026, https://mediapi.unios.in)

Read-only requests without sign-in. "Live" = the route answers (protected routes reply
`{"success":false,"error":"NOT_AUTHORISED"}` with HTTP 200; the app treats that as signed out).

| Status | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| Live (GET, probed) | `/api/auth/me`, `/api/doctors`, `/api/doctors/dashboard-list`, `/api/subscriptions/plans`, `/api/schedule/slots/:doctorId/:date`, `/api/appointments/patient`, `/api/appointments/doctor`, `/api/video/appointments/:id/join` |
| Not probed (write routes the team's code already used) | `POST /api/auth/send-otp`, `POST /api/auth/verify-otp`, `PATCH /api/onboarding/step`, `POST /api/onboarding/complete`, `PUT /api/schedule/book`, `POST /api/chat/init`, `POST /api/video/appointments/:id/end`, `POST /api/subscriptions/activate` |
| Called by the app as existing, but **missing** on the live server (GET answered 404) | `GET /api/patient/profile`, `GET /api/address/my-addresses`, `GET /api/doctor/patients`, `GET /api/doctor/me`, `GET /api/subscriptions/status`. Their write routes (`PATCH /api/patient/*`, `POST /api/address/add`) were not probed; check them with the profile routes. |
| Missing (as expected) | every PROPOSED endpoint below |

Also seen: every plan from `/api/subscriptions/plans` has `"Price": null`. The plans screen shows
the team's original "Free" label for a null price, so set real prices before launch.
