 * The state of booking a home blood test, one decision per step: package, address, person, time,
 * then review and pay. Two modes:
 *   "dashboard"   the patient picks any Redcliffe package (/patient-dashboard/lab-tests/book).
 *   "onboarding"  the patient picks a care package that includes lab tests (lab tests and
 *                 consultation); its Redcliffe package is booked and the booking carries the care
 *                 package code, so the backend charges the package price.
 * Choosing again at any step drops a slot hold made from the old choices (the backend cancels that
 * hold when the next one is made). The host owns this state, so its own Back can step through it.
