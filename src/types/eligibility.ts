 *   OWN_REPORT  uploads a report from the last 3 months; pays nothing until approved.
 *   LAB_TEST    prepays the lab-and-consultation package; Redcliffe collects a sample at home and
 *               its report reaches the back office directly (the patient uploads nothing).
 * The back office (admin) reviews the report either way. The backend owns every stage change.
