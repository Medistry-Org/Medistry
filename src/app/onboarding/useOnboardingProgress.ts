/**
 * The onboarding state machine: the patient's answers, which screen is showing, and moving forward
 * (save the step, then the next one), back and out. The answers and their checks are in
 * onboardingDraft.ts and onboardingStepAnswer.ts; question 9's paths in useBloodTestPath.ts. Order of calls: questions 1 to 8 are each saved
 * (PATCH /api/onboarding/step); after question 8 the profile is completed (POST
 * /api/onboarding/complete); only then comes the blood test step (question 9), which branches:
 *   yes  "upload"  the report is uploaded for review (purpose ELIGIBILITY), then "sent".
 *   no   "lab"     the care package with lab tests, booked with the shared lab booking flow.
 *
 * Every answer is saved as soon as Continue is pressed, so "Save and exit" only has to leave.
